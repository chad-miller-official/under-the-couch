					<h2><a href="#overview">Overview</a></h2>
					<b>Musician's Network</b> is the organization that runs Under the Couch.
					As well as maintaining UTC, we offer a number of services for musicians
					and music-lovers, including:

					<ul>
						<li>Lockers to store your equipment</li>
						<li>A place for you/your band to practice</li>
						<li>A professional recording studio</li>
						<li>A great place to meet people with similar interests</li>
						<li>A great place to start a band (or find that one badly needed drummer)</li>
					</ul>

					We have meetings every Monday at 7 PM here at Under the Couch. Becoming a member
					costs $10 and comes with a free UTC t-shirt (alternatively, membership is free with
					the purchase of one $10 UTC t-shirt). Membership gives you access to everything listed
					above, as well as guarantees you free admission to all of our shows! What kind of
					fantastic deal is that?
					<br /><br />
					For more information about any of this, come to one of our 7 o’clock meetings and see what
					we’re all about.
