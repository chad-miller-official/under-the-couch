					<p>Every Thursday evening at Under the Couch is <b>Open Mic Night</b>!</p>
                    <p>
					    Starting at 8:30 PM, our doors are open for students to show other students what they've got up on
					    stage. Or, if you don't feel like going up on stage, it's a great place to relax on our couches and
					    get some free entertainment.
                    </p>
					<p>Sign-ups are from 8 PM to 9 PM, and acts begin at 8:30 PM.</p>
